//! App-lifecycle entry for the keeper shell (Epic 14-1).
//!
//! This is the single Rust seam through which every app-lifecycle transition
//! (background / foreground) flows. On iOS the zero-native stopgap drives it
//! from the webview `visibilitychange` event; a later micro Swift
//! `UIApplication` plugin (`didEnterBackground` / `willEnterForeground`) will
//! call this SAME command — so the command signature is kept stable for that
//! upgrade path. Desktop never invokes it: the frontend attaches no listener on
//! the desktop tier, preserving Story 10.3 background operation.
//!
//! There is exactly one lifecycle command and no competing resume path:
//! foreground delegates to [`AccountManager::sync_now`] (the same sync-kick
//! pull-to-refresh uses, Story 13.6) and background delegates to
//! [`AccountManager::pause_all`] (graceful `SyncService::stop`, never teardown).
